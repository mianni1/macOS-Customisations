# MacOS Setup Scripts

This repository contains a shell script for setting up some of the things I like to have in my macOS environment. 

I plan on adding more to this repo however there will be things that Apple do not allow to be modified with scripts such as enabling FileVault and escrowing the key to a logged in iCloud account :(
